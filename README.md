# Project_2_Web-Scraped_Data_Analysis
Web Scraping Based Project Using Hockey Reference Website and Affiliated Data to Perform Data Analysis and Visualization Using Seaborn

Goal: From the website of your choice, setup a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data. Answers should be given programmatically as output and at least two questions should have answers demonstrated via a plot. Seaborn should be used to plot your analysis. Your plots should include data labels, and a title that summarizes your conclusion, and, styling should be applied.

Data Questions

    1)  Of the Top 50 Goal Scorers from the 2024-2025 NHL Season, what Percentage of their Goals Scored come from Even Strength Goals vs
